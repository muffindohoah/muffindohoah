definitely going to add more hidden java artsy animations/interactible things cause theyre relatively quick to make and artsy.
probably going to switch this to another host to update, it's a little cleaner than poksocks because i had more time focused on the css.
might actually redo portfolio so it's an actual portfolio (or just sync it to poksocks twt so i dont have to remember this exists).
might fix the axis center of that goober on the tower so he swings the right way if i get bored enough.
